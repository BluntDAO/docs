# ðŸŽ‰ How to Start A Sesh

## A Sesh

A "sesh", a street slang for a session, indicates a BluntDAO activation where members or the general public art actively smoking in a zone

## Some Ingredients to A Good Sesh

* Vibes
* Bud, bring yourself or find a local plug looking to sponsor
* Materials like a grinders, paper or preolls
* Easy, smoke friendly spot

#### Some Tips

* its always easier to start a sesh somewhere else than all the logistics of starting your own independent event. We reccomend you lean on existing events. Even starting a Sesh outside the line for an event is a good way to network / onboard before the party has started.
* We have some activities already that are on brand; Examples include
  * Who can pearl the best blunt?
  * Chicago / Taxi: hold the hit until the rotation
  * Who can smoke the longest without tapping out?
  * Who can roll the longest blunt?
  * Who can roll with one hand?
  * Who can roll the biggest blunt

#### Low Budget Events

* Touch Grass: a decentralized activation series where we go to a park and spark

## If You Are Looking For Funding

We expect the following to fund a sesh.&#x20;

* At least 5 people
* Community partners to lean on
* Knowledge of on-chain or some onboarding member

If you are not crashing another event and doing a stand alone event

* Good music

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be cognizant of the laws in your area regarding smoking in public. This is not legal advice, and BluntDAO is super compliant

On-chain Tips

* If you are onboarding people IRL, have good internet. Make sure you have a code from an OG validator for effective onboarding
