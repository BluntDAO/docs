## Proof of Sesh

Proof of Sesh has evolved over time. We have used providers like Satori (NEAR), Sharddog (NEAR), POAP (Eth), Cupcake (SOLANA), SOAP (Solana), but also different partners have built custom solutions

* GenaDrop [DropWallet](https://t.me/dropwalletbot) - this account abstracted telegram wallet has a secreet passcode for onboarding members that is referral based and posts to Web3 social, mints a NFT for the respective smoking sesh, and triggers a DAO proposal to add the new member on NEAR Protocol
* [GenaDrop](https://www.genadrop.io/mint/sesh) - this early sesh allows you to mint a single NFT with your Camera across NEAR, Aurora, Algorand, Polygon, Avalanche, and Arbitrum.
