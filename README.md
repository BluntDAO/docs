## About BluntDAO

BluntDAO is the the biggest IRL onboarding movement to Web3 via Proof of Sesh through local IRL OGs. We are now introducing the [unlimited sesh fund](https://blunts.wtf), a regular re-up mechanism where anyone can request ETH to host a sesh from contributors. Onboarding the next million, 1 blunt/sesh at a time.

A DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization, essentially a way to coordinate via wallets (aka accounts) using blockchain.&#x20;

We have our core members (OG Validators), and our funders who buy in via NFT auctions at [blunts.wtf](https://blunts.wtf) to control the treasury to fund future seshes.&#x20;

## How to Get In

**GET SMOKED IN via** Proof of Sesh.&#x20;

Proof of Sesh is how BluntDAO started. In BluntDAOs their is an OG validator who is a member who has Proof of Sesh'd with another member IRL and now has the NFT. This means this person can smoke with you in real life and then you can mint a NFT to then yourself become an OG Validators. (Not any unofficial onboarding)



What can you smoke?

* Any type of device at Bud. It use to be just Blunts.&#x20;

You can vote on the DAO as a siegnal, this is different than token holders who vote on what happens with the sesh, however there are non-purchases blunts.wtf OUNCE NFTs that are given to OG Validators to give governance from the real ogs.&#x20;

## The Funds

The unlimited sesh fund.

1/4.20 of the NFTs are given to new and respected OG Validator. You need to have a Blunts.wtf NFT or an OUNCE in order to cast a propsoals. Proposals have access to the sesh fund in whcih most of the funds are spent on onboard



1 NFT a day has been auctioned since 4/20/2024 at around the price of an ounce. Thus why we can the NFT an "Ounce"&#x20;
