# üõçÔ∏è Secondary Sales

Since OUNCE is a NFT Collection on Base, it is automatically indexed by popular secondary marketplaces, like Zora, OpenSea, and Rarible. However this is a zero royalty collection, and since money from the daily auctions to the treasury, and you could always just bid on the current collection, we prefer you just auction.



However in the future, it maybe harder to get certain NFTs for a certain price point at the speed you want to enter the community. Additionally, some OUNCERs may need to sell their NFT, or market makers may want to sweep the collection. Generally we want OUNCERS to be in the community as they govern the fund, and we want as many OUNCERS to also be OG Validators on BluntDAO. But it is important that we create a lively secondary sales marketplaces in order for those to sell their NFTs, buy new ones they prefer, and create more incentivies and marketing around the collection.&#x20;
