# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Bidding on the Collection

We call it an ounce because generally we want the price to be around an OUNCE so we can theoretically have an OUNCE in bound into the treasury a day.

## Rules of Bidding

* Its around $0.01 to put in a bid (based on the transaction fees on [Base](https://www.base.org/))
* The NFT Collection is on Base and bids are done in ETHEREUM on Base the native gas of the L2. You can bridge directly from Ethereum mainnet using [the bridge](https://bridge.base.org/deposit), or get ETH on Base directly from the Coinbase Exchange.&#x20;
* Each bid must be 0.021 ETH higher than the last one.&#x20;
* The same account cannot outbid itself.
